Background:
Nearly a century ago, Bradbury and Eggleston provided the first documented description of postural
orthostatic hypotension [1]. It is now widely recognized and is thought to affect approximately 16% to
30% of adults aged 65 years or older [2]. Orthostatic Hypotension is associated with a significantly
increased risk of all-cause mortality, incident coronary heart disease, heart failure and stroke [3]. It is
also associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation [4], venous thromboembolism [5] and chronic
kidney disease [6]. Current pharmacological treatments are suboptimal in terms of symptom relief
and often limited by serious side effects [7] including severe supine hypertension and its deleterious
effects. Systemic Arterial pressure is maintained via a complex orchestration of physical, chemical
and biological processes [8]. We propose that supracardiac venous outflow impairment disrupts this
regulation and contributes to orthostatic hypotension. The scientific rationale for this involves several
interconnected mechanisms.
a) Venous return is a critical determinant of cardiac output. There is a profound effect of gravity in
the upright position with pooling of more than 500 ml of blood in the venous capacitance vessels and
splanchnic circulation leading to a decrease in venous return and a drop in cardiac output of nearly
20% [7]. This produces a remarkable decrease in mean arterial pressure at the level of the head [9].
Additionally, cerebral autoregulation is less able to maintain stable perfusion during sudden hypotension
as compared to sudden hypertension [10]. Under normal circumstances this is quickly counteracted by
multiple mechanisms leading to a smooth asymptomatic postural transition. Given that venous return is
a difference between mean systemic venous pressure and the resistance to venous return [VR = Pmsv
- Rv ] [11], venous valvular stenoses will impede venous return in proportion the number of stenosed
valves and to the degree to which they are stenosed.
b) The body’s primary defense against OH is the baroreflex mechanism. Ketch et al. provide a
detailed description of this process, where baroreceptors in the carotid sinus and aortic arch detect
changes in blood pressure. This information is transmitted to the brain stem via the glossopharyngeal
and vagus nerves. The nucleus tractus solitarii in the dorsal medulla processes this input, and the caudal and rostral ventrolateral medulla modulate sympathetic outflow in response. This complex system
aims to maintain blood pressure by adjusting heart rate and vascular tone [12]. The efficiency of this
regulatory mechanism depends on proper metabolite clearance, which is governed by the Fick principle
[13]. This principle states that the rate of metabolite removal from an organ is proportional to the difference in metabolite concentration between arterial and venous blood and the blood flow to the organ. In
the context of OH, any impairment in venous outflow can disrupt this process, potentially exacerbating
the condition. We thus concluded that improving venous outflow via venous angioplasty or stenting
of the large supracradiac veins may ameliorate orthostatic hypotension and orthostatic intolerance at
least to a degree that is tolerable by patients.

Methods:
Intervention:
• Access
The procedure begins with vascular access, which is achieved by prepping the access site using
standard sterile precautions to minimize the risk of infection. Common venous access sites include the common femoral veins, basilic veins, and the internal or external jugular veins, depending on the location of the venous obstruction and patient anatomy. Using the sterile Seldinger
technique, a micropuncture kit is employed to puncture the vein and obtain access. Once access
is confirmed, a sheath is placed to facilitate the introduction of catheters and other devices. The
size of the sheath depends on procedural needs and typically ranges from 5F to 9F, with an 8F
sheath being most commonly used in the right common femoral vein. In cases where arterial
access is required, either the femoral artery (preferred site: right common femoral artery) or the
radial artery can be used. Similar sterile techniques are applied, and a 5F or 6F sheath is inserted to allow for arterial catheterization. This arterial access may be necessary for adjunctive
imaging or interventions during complex venous procedures.

• Reporting: The management of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) during
and after interventional procedures involves a structured, proactive approach to ensure patient
safety and mitigate risks. Once an AE is identified, the immediate priority is to stabilize the patient
and address the complication based on its severity. For minor events, supportive measures such
as observation or symptomatic treatment may suffice, while major complications may require
urgent therapeutic interventions, such as additional procedures, escalation of care, or surgical
consultation. A robust escalation protocol is critical, ensuring that all team members are trained
to recognize complications early and initiate appropriate responses. For example, in cases of
bleeding or vascular injury, measures such as hemostatic agents, transfusions, or endovascular
repair can be employed promptly. Post-procedurally, patients are closely monitored for early
signs of complications. This includes regular clinical assessments, imaging when necessary, and
laboratory evaluations (e.g., coagulation profiles). Clear discharge instructions are provided for
outpatient cases, detailing symptoms that may indicate complications (e.g., swelling, pain, fever)
and emergency contact information for the care team.
Serious AEs are documented and reported according to institutional protocols. Root cause analysis is conducted for SAEs to identify contributing factors—whether technical, procedural, or
systemic—and develop strategies to prevent recurrence. Regular presentations at the neurovascular performance improvement meetings will facilitate shared learning among practitioners by
reviewing adverse outcomes in a non-punitive environment. Recommendations from these reviews may lead to updates in procedural protocols, enhanced training programs, and improved
patient pathways to strengthen overall safety of the procedure.
Funding:
None.
Scientific Benefit:
This study will provide valuable insights into the potential benefits of supracardiac venous angioplasty
and stenting for patients with orthostatic intolerance and hypotension. The results may lead to new
treatment options for these challenging conditions and improve our understanding of their underlying
mechanisms, particularly the role of venous outflow obstruction disorders (VOODO) in neurological
health.
Subject Recruitment and Selection:
Patients with diagnosed orthostatic intolerance or orthostatic hypotension who have evidence of jugular
vein or brachiocephalic vein stenosis on imaging studies will be recruited from neurology, primary care
and cardiology offices. We aim to enroll 100 participants over a 24-month period.
Location:
The study will be conducted at St. Francis Hospital and Heart Center, 100 Port Washington Blvd,
Roslyn, NY 11576.

Research Design:
• Prospective: This is a prospective, single-arm, unblinded registry trial to evaluate the effects of
supracardiac venous angioplasty and stenting on orthostatic intolerance and orthostatic hypotension.
• Inclusion criteria for Prospective Cohort:
1. Age 18 years
2. Diagnosed orthostatic intolerance or orthostatic hypotension not responding to standard
medical management or complicated by supine hypertension
3. Able to provide informed consent
• Exclusion criteria for Prospective Cohort:
1. Pregnancy or breastfeeding
2. Active infection
3. Coagulopathy or contraindication to anticoagulation therapy
• Statistical Analysis: We will use paired t-tests to compare pre- and post-intervention measures
of orthostatic intolerance and hypotension. Quality of life scores will be analyzed using repeated
measures ANOVA. A p-value < 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Sample size calculation indicates that 100 participants will provide 80% power to detect a clinically meaningful
difference in orthostatic symptoms.
Potential Risks:
1. Procedural risks: bleeding, infection, vessel injury, thrombosis, stroke, intra and extracranial hemorrhage, mortality
2. Radiation exposure from fluoroscopy
3. Contrast-induced nephropathy
4. Stent-related complications: migration, perforation, restenosis, pain, fracture of a stent, erosion
into surrounding structures
5. Potential worsening of symptoms
Protection of Subjects:
All patient data will be de-identified and stored on secure, password-protected servers. Only authorized
study personnel will have access to the data. Participants will be closely monitored for adverse events
throughout the study period.

Potential Benefits:
1. Improvement in orthostatic intolerance and hypotension symptoms
2. Enhanced quality of life
3. Reduced medication dependence
4. Contribution to scientific knowledge
The Risk/Benefit Ratio:
While there are potential risks associated with the procedure, the potential benefits of improved symptoms and quality of life outweigh these risks for patients. The study will provide valuable information on
a novel treatment approach for a challenging clinical problem.
