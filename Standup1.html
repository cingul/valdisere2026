OH is conventionally defined as a sustained reduction in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of at least 10 mmHg within three minutes of standing, while OI encompasses a broader syndrome of upright intolerance marked by dizziness, presyncope, fatigue, visual disturbance, or syncope that improves with recumbency. These conditions disproportionately affect older adults and patients with autonomic dysfunction and are associated with increased risks of falls, cardiovascular morbidity, stroke, cognitive impairment, and mortality.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Current management strategies rely primarily on pharmacologic augmentation of blood pressure using agents such as midodrine, fludrocortisone, droxidopa, and pyridostigmine. However, these therapies are frequently limited by incomplete symptom relief and dose-limiting adverse effects, including supine hypertension, fluid retention, hypokalemia, heart failure exacerbation, urologic complications, headaches, palpitations, fatigue, and muscle weakness. As a result, many patients remain symptomatic despite escalating medication regimens, highlighting the need for alternative therapeutic approaches that address upstream pathophysiology rather than downstream compensation alone.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Systemic arterial pressure during postural change is maintained through a complex integration of cardiovascular, autonomic, and neurovascular mechanisms. Central to this process is the baroreflex, whereby mechanoreceptors in the carotid sinus and aortic arch detect changes in arterial pressure and relay afferent signals to brainstem nuclei, including the nucleus tractus solitarius and ventrolateral medulla. These centers modulate sympathetic outflow to adjust heart rate, vascular tone, and venous capacitance in anticipation of and response to standing. The effectiveness of this reflex arc depends not only on intact neural signaling but also on the metabolic environment of autonomic control centers.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Venous return is a critical determinant of cardiac output and arterial pressure, governed by the pressure gradient between mean systemic filling pressure and right atrial pressure and inversely proportional to resistance to venous return. Upon standing, gravitational pooling of blood within the splanchnic and lower-extremity venous capacitance vessels reduces venous return by several hundred milliliters, resulting in a transient reduction in cardiac output and cerebral perfusion pressure. Under normal circumstances, rapid sympathetic activation and venoconstriction counteract these effects, allowing for a smooth, asymptomatic postural transition.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We propose that supracardiac venous outflow obstruction&mdash;particularly involving the internal jugular, brachiocephalic, or related venous structures&mdash;disrupts this finely tuned system and contributes to the development or persistence of OH and OI. Venous stenosis or valvular pathology may impede venous return and elevate upstream venous pressures, thereby reducing effective preload and compromising cardiac output during orthostasis. Importantly, these effects may be magnified in the upright position, when venous resistance and gravitational forces are already increased.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Beyond its hemodynamic consequences, impaired cerebral venous outflow may also exert profound effects on autonomic regulation through disrupted metabolite clearance. According to the Fick principle, the rate of metabolite removal from tissue is proportional to blood flow and the arterial&ndash;venous concentration gradient. When venous drainage is impaired, reduced flow through the cerebral microcirculation may delay clearance of metabolites from key autonomic centers. Experimental and translational studies have identified metabolites such as imidazoleacetic acid ribotide, glutamate, and extracellular potassium as modulators of neuronal excitability within vestibulo-sympathetic and baroreflex pathways. Accumulation of such metabolites during states of cerebral congestion or hypoperfusion may suppress sympathetic output and blunt baroreflex sensitivity, leading to delayed or insufficient cardiovascular compensation during standing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The vestibulo-sympathetic reflex provides an additional layer of anticipatory regulation during postural transitions. Vestibular inputs from the inner ear are integrated with autonomic control centers to initiate sympathetic activation prior to or concurrent with standing. Disruption of this reflex&mdash;whether through vestibular deconditioning, impaired neural integration, or altered metabolic signaling&mdash;can result in failure of sympathetic anticipation and exaggerated orthostatic blood pressure drops. Evidence from microgravity and spaceflight research supports the importance of this pathway, as astronauts frequently develop orthostatic intolerance upon return to Earth due to vestibular deconditioning and impaired sympathetic coupling. Chronic cerebral venous congestion may interfere with these same circuits, producing a similar phenotype of delayed autonomic response.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We further hypothesize that venous tone in patients with OH and OI may become pathologically static. In this model, excessive venous constriction in the supine position contributes to supine hypertension, while inadequate dynamic venoconstriction during standing exacerbates hypotension. Persistent venous outflow obstruction may perpetuate this maladaptive state by maintaining chronic congestion and preventing appropriate venous compliance adjustments in response to postural stress. Improving venous outflow could therefore restore more dynamic venous tone, potentially mitigating both supine hypertension and standing hypotension.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">An additional mechanistic pathway may involve disruption of the cerebral glymphatic system, a perivascular network responsible for clearing metabolic waste from the brain. Glymphatic outflow occurs primarily along perivenous spaces and is dependent on unobstructed venous drainage. Supracardiac venous congestion may increase intracranial venous pressure, compress perivenous pathways, and impair glymphatic clearance. Reduced clearance of neuroactive metabolites from brainstem autonomic centers could further contribute to sympathetic blunting and orthostatic intolerance. Restoration of venous outflow through endovascular intervention may alleviate venous engorgement, improve glymphatic drainage, and enhance metabolic homeostasis within autonomic control circuits.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Preliminary clinical observations support these mechanistic hypotheses. In an initial case series of six patients with severe, medically refractory OH, venographic evaluation identified supracardiac venous stenosis, and endovascular treatment with balloon angioplasty and/or stenting was associated with improvements in orthostatic blood pressure measurements and clinical symptoms. These patients had failed or were intolerant of standard pharmacologic therapies, suggesting that correction of venous outflow obstruction may address a previously underrecognized contributor to orthostatic syndromes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Building on this emerging body of evidence, the present study evaluates the clinical, pharmacologic, and physiologic outcomes of supracardiac venous angioplasty and stenting in a larger cohort of patients with OH or OI. We hypothesized that improving venous outflow would lead to clinically meaningful reductions in orthostatic blood pressure drop, decreased reliance on blood pressure&ndash;raising medications, and improved global clinical status, reflecting restoration of autonomic and circulatory homeostasis across multiple domains.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
